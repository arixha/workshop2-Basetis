**For the force directed graph:**
The basic version: https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph?collection=@d3/d3-force
Adding stickness to the layout so we could drag it: https://observablehq.com/@d3/sticky-force-layout?collection=@d3/d3-force
If we could add hierarchy, I like this tree layout: https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-tree?collection=@d3/d3-force
A version with arrows: https://observablehq.com/@d3/mobile-patent-suits
This version zooms: https://observablehq.com/@scax/force-directed-graph-with-zoom-and-stroke-scaling-svg
This one has a nice hover feature where you see the node plus it's related elements: http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler/10586116

I think the most important of these is to get some kind of hover highlight so you can see information flows, and probably also stickiness.
